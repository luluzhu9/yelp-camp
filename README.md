## About
I created a CRUD web application of a community site for campers in 1 month using Javascript ES6, JSX, and CSS3, and applied ReactJS for the frontend, Firebase for the backend’s user authentication and real time database, and DayJS from NodeJS for date time objects.

In this project, I focused on cross-browser compatibility, accessibility, and responsive web development by conducting cross-browser and device compatibility testing to adhere to web accessibility standards (WCAG) and SEO best practices.

Some of the ways I did this was:
- Responsive web development
- Validating HTML, CSS, JS using linters and W3's validator
- Using BrowserStack to emulate on difference devices and screen sizes; works for Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, Edge, and on Mac, Windows, and Android
- General practices such as defining a DOCTYPE, keeping the code simple and reusable, and emphasizing interactive items with hover effects
- Checking WCAG standards by testing color contrast on W3, accessiblity on WAVE, SEO and performance on Pagespeed
