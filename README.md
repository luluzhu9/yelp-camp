## About
I created a CRUD web application of a community site for campers in 1 month using Javascript ES6, JSX, and CSS3, and applied ReactJS for the frontend, Firebase for the backendâ€™s user authentication and real time database, and DayJS from NodeJS for date time objects.

In this project, I focused on cross-browser compatibility, accessibility, and responsive web development by conducting cross-browser and device compatibility testing to adhere to web accessibility standards (WCAG) and SEO best practices through responsive web development, linters, and general practices.
